title: "Performers' Playground: Complication Street"

In August I finished a R&D with Mark Winstanely and Alice Robinson's Performers Playground Company, developing a commedia dell'arte street theatre show. It was performed in Manchester at various outdoor locations, as well as at Gorse Hill Studios. It was directed by Ollie Crick.
