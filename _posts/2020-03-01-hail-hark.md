title: Hark! Hail!
---

I'm working on a new solo project about the systems of power, ego, apathy and the madness of hope. It is centred on Keng, who is a King, a surreal and grotesque outsider, who calls for the audience to take down the system, in order to reinstate the system. Borrowing from DIY live-art culture, Hark! Hail! is a raucous, stupid show.

I did a scratch of the work at the Lowry Theatre on 20 Feb which was excellent and full of surprises.
