{% include image.html url="/assets/img/saucy.png" alt="Saucy Leonardo" description="" width="300" float="left" %}

<div class="text-block" markdown="1">

A family of undertakers must deal with the revived corpse of Leonardo da Vinci, putting to the test the battle between art and greed. Performed at the SHUN Manchester in 2018.

Unfortunately this WIP wasn't very well documented and there is only this saucy photo of Charlie as Leonardo.
