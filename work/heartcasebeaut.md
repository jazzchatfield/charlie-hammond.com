Designed for theatre and fringe spaces, but unable to settle on a name, Heartcase/Beaut was an idiot's exploration of romance as told through pinterest-style love captions, adulterous shadow puppetry, and literally fishing for audience members. Featured the likes of Elvis Presley, Marvin Gaye and Justin Bieber (in lyric form only).

It was first scratched at the West Yorkshire Playhouse Leeds in 2015 and subsequently turned into a full show for the Manchester Fringe Festival 2016.
