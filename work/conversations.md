title: Conversations with my dead selves
---

With support from The Lowry Theatre, Charlie explored some audio ideas and generally played around until some content appeared. He then hit upon the idea of creating conversations with himself through time, recording the first part of the recording (leaving gaps for future Charlie) and re-recording the reply once time had passed. This became an interesting (if at times meandering) record of how quickly thoughts and moods change, and continues Charlie's interest in how people conceive their identity as a complete consistent reasonable 'self'. The recordings were made with the help of sound designer and audio wizard Ben Leverett-Jaques.

Charlie and Ben also created this creepy, binaural audio (best enjoyed with headphones), for upcoming project Brain Worms :
